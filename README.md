You are required to develop something like this using pure web development tools. You can use CSS or any other animation libraries such as [anime js](https://github.com/juliangarnier/anime), [mo js](https://github.com/legomushroom/mojs). 
Originality and creativity will be appreciated.

When you develop the animated logo please select the logo type according to your preferred type (Web/Mobile). and also make sure to **follow the folder structure when you submit your work.**

- For Web Apps based logos - `For_Web/<your_name>/<Please put your code, source files here>`

Please send a PR with the name as `<your_name>_For_Mobile_Logo`. Include a link (Google Drive Link) to your final output(Short Video Clip/Screen Cast Video) in the PR message

If work is good, later we might use this in our mobile or web application splash screens.
